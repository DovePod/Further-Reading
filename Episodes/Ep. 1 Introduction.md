### Note:

I hope that you enjoyed the intro to this show! The reason that I went in no depth at all in this episode is not because that's how I will be doing this show, but rather I don't want the intro to be a real episode as much as just a preview to how random it will be.
I would love for this show to be as enjoyable as it can be, but I have to make a compromise with how much information I will include in it to make sure that I don't frighten anyone, so they can just enjoy it.
So for the rest of this show I will be talking about a wide range of topics **Not just philosophy** with a good amount of detail, but if you want to learn more about the topic at all this will be your place to go.

This line used in episode 1 was inspired by Alan Watts' 2.5.6 Art of Meditation.\

**[Src 2.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egocentric_predicament)**\
 Egocentric predicament, a term coined by Ralph Barton Perry in an article (Journal of Philosophy 1910), is the problem of not being able to view reality outside of our own perceptions. All worldly knowledge takes the form of mental representations that our mind examines in different ways. Direct contact with reality cannot be made outside of our own minds; therefore, we cannot be sure reality even exists. This means that we are each limited to our own perceptual world and views. Solipsism is an extension of this which assumes that only one's own mind is sure to exist.

Since 1710, when George Berkeley broached in his fashion the problem of the egocentric predicament, denying the existence of material substance except as ideas in the minds of perceivers, and thus asserting a problematical relation with reality, hence has this thesis proved a stumbling block.

**[Src 4.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solipsism)** -- Unspoken\
Solipsism (/ˈsɒlɪpsɪzəm/); from Latin solus 'alone', and ipse 'self') is the philosophical idea that only one's mind is sure to exist. As an epistemological position, solipsism holds that knowledge of anything outside one's own mind is unsure; the external world and other minds cannot be known and might not exist outside the mind.

**[Src 5.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjective_idealism)**\
Subjective idealism, or empirical idealism, is a form of philosophical monism that holds that only minds and mental contents exist. It entails and is generally identified or associated with immaterialism, the doctrine that material things do not exist. Subjective idealism rejects dualism, neutral monism, and materialism; indeed, it is the contrary of eliminative materialism, the doctrine that all or some classes of mental phenomena (such as emotions, beliefs, or desires) do not exist, but are sheer illusions.
